The model can be further improved with more advanced preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.\n","\n","Further improvements could include using **feature selection** and experimenting with other kernel functions for SVR, such as the **linear kernel**."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
